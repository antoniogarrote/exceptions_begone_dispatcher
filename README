=== Exceptions Begone Dispatcher and Client

Dispatcher: A web server written in Erlang capable of using RabbitMQ to process Exception Begone notifications and dispatch them through web socket connections.

Client: A Sprotucore Javascript client that can be used to connect to a Exceptions Begone dispatcher:

=== Exceptions Begone Client : Configuration

  Edit /exceptions_client/apps/exception_client/configuration.js and with:
  - The domain of the Dispatcher server
  - The port of the Dispatcher server
  - the path to the exceptions resource ("/exceptions" by default)

=== Exceptions Begone Client : Build

  - Install sproutcore (gem install sproutcore)
  - $ sc-build

=== Exceptions Begone Client : Running

  - Deploy the resulting html + js files in a web server
  - Alternatively, un sc-server and connect to http://localhost:4020/exceptions_client


=== Exceptions Begone Server : Configuration

  Edit /exceptions_dispatcher/lib/exceptions_server/ebin/exceptions_server.app with:
  - Port where the server is going to listen
  - Docroot for static files

=== Exceptions Begone Server : Build

  - $./install_deps.sh    #intall dependencies
  - $./install            # builds the server

Right now, it only slightly works.

Enjoy.
